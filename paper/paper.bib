In a series of three case studies, PASCal is used to reanalyse previously published lattice parameter data and show that additional scientific insight is obtainable in each case. First, the two-dimensional metal-organic framework [Cu2(OH)(C8H3O7S)(H2O)].2H2O is found to exhibit the strongest area negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect yet observed; second, the widely used explosive HMX exhibits much stronger mechanical anisotropy than had previously been anticipated, including uniaxial NTE driven by thermal changes in molecular conformation; and third, the high-pressure form of the mineral malayaite is shown to exhibit a strong negative linear compressibility effect that arises from correlated tilting of SnO6 and SiO4 coordination polyhedra.},

  abstract = {Silver(I) hexacyanocobaltate(III), Ag(3)[Co(CN)(6)], shows a large negative linear compressibility (NLC, linear expansion under hydrostatic pressure) at ambient temperature at all pressures up to our experimental limit of 7.65(2) GPa. This behavior is qualitatively unaffected by a transition at 0.19 GPa to a new phase Ag(3)[Co(CN)(6)]-II, whose structure is reported here. The high-pressure phase also shows anisotropic thermal expansion with large uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE, expansion on cooling). In both phases, the NLC/NTE effect arises as the rapid compression/contraction of layers of silver atoms--weakly bound via argentophilic interactions--is translated via flexing of the covalent network lattice into an expansion along a perpendicular direction. It is proposed that framework materials that contract along a specific direction on heating while expanding macroscopically will, in general, also expand along the same direction under hydrostatic pressure while contracting macroscopically.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {In the near future, the targets for lithium-ion batteries concerning specific energy and cost can advantageously be met by introducing layered LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathode materials with a high Ni content (x {$\geq$} 0.6). Increasing the Ni content allows for the utilization of more lithium at a given cell voltage, thereby improving the specific capacity but at the expense of cycle life. Here, the capacity-fading mechanisms of both typical low-Ni NCM (x = 0.33, NCM111) and high-Ni NCM (x = 0.8, NCM811) cathodes are investigated and compared from crystallographic and microstructural viewpoints. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals that the unit cells undergo different volumetric changes of around 1.2 and 5.1\% for NCM111 and NCM811, respectively, when cycled between 3.0 and 4.3 V vs Li/Li+. Volume changes for NCM811 are largest for x(Li) {$<$} 0.5 because of the severe decrease in interlayer lattice parameter c from 14.467(1) to 14.030(1) \AA. In agreement, in situ light microscopy reveals that delithiation leads to different volume contractions of the secondary particles of (3.3 {$\pm$} 2.4) and (7.8 {$\pm$} 1.5)\% for NCM111 and NCM811, respectively. And postmortem cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates more significant microcracking in the case of NCM811. Overall, the results establish that the accelerated aging of NCM811 is related to the disintegration of secondary particles caused by intergranular fracture, which is driven by mechanical stress at the interfaces between the primary crystallites.}
